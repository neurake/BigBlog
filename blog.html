    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Home Minister Amit Shah had a lot to say during his weekend visit to Telangana to celebrate the anniversary of the Nizam of Hyderabad's accession to India. He said the central government has decided to celebrate September 17 as "Liberation Day" from the rule of the Nizam and the Razakars. The Razakars as we know, were the Nizam's private militias under the control of Qasim Rizvi who was allowed to go to Pakistan. Shah accused those who rule Telangana, and those who had ruled India, of being scared of present day Razakars which is why they did not observe the day. In his message of gratitude to those who, according to him, fought the Nizam and Razakars, he specifically mentioned the Hindu Mahasabha and the Arya Samaj. And of course repeated his gratitude to Vallabhbhai Patel. Thus India's Home Minister presented it as a classic case of Hindus vs Muslims - and the Indian army "liberating" a state from the grip of a despotic Muslim ruler under the leadership of "Iron man" Patel.

      You could call this a distortion of history, a deficit of truth or a bunch of lies. Whatever.
      
      Yes, there was a "liberation" in Telangana, only it was not the chronology recited by Amit Shah. The rule of the Nizam was one of cruel feudal oppression based on the power of the zamindars, the Deshmukhs, the "doras" as they were called. They included the Hindu upper caste rural elite who provided a strong support base for the Nizam's rule. The Razakars were used in great measure to support these Hindu and Muslim oppressors, the symbols of the Nizam.The system was based on revenue collections for the Nizam's coffers through rack renting, through forced slave labour, the "vetti" system, mass evictions and takeover of the land from cultivating peasants, the provision of free services to the landed families. Sexual exploitation of poor rural women was rampant.
      
      In 1946, the peasantry, the landless, the artisans, the women in the districts of what is now Telangana under the leadership of the Communist party-led Andhra Mahasabha, took up arms against the hated regime of the Nizam. This struggle was for the liberation of the peasantry and landless workers, the Dalits and Adivasis, from the heavy burden of feudal oppression. There was no element of religion in the struggle. The oppressors were both Hindu and Muslim just as the fighters against them were also Hindu and Muslim peasants. In the following years till 1951, when the struggle was withdrawn, facing the might of the Nizam and the Razakars, the peasants fought and liberated more than 3,000 villages, establishing "gram raj" based on justice and equality and the land distributionof 10 lakh acres; they attempted a radical transformation in social relations against the caste system and the subordination of women. More than 4,000 were martyred in this struggle. The symbol of this struggle was Ailamma, the heroic woman from an oppressed caste in Palakurthi village in Jalgaon Taluka. The hated Deshmukh of this area, V Ramachandra Reddy, sent his armed goondas to forcibly harvest the crop from her field where she and her family were tenants. Supported by the Andhra Maha Sabha and the red flag, she fought back and finally prevented the loot of the crop. This acted like the proverbial spark and the prairie fire of resistance spread. This struggle for liberation from the Nizam, from feudal oppression, from the British colonial rule, greatly weakened the rule of the Nizam. The Arya Samaj and the Hindu Mahasabha were nowhere in sight. The glorious history is available in the book written by P Sundarayya, a leading Communist organizer at that time, and later the General Secretary of the CPI(M).
      
      It is a fact of history that the Nizam refused to accede to India. Under pressure from the liberation struggle of the peasantry and the government of India, he signed the "Standstill Agreement" with in November 1947 which legally gave him a year of transition during which foreign affairs, defence and communications were to be under the control of the government of India, while he was permitted control of domestic affairs. Patel was Home Minister. It was he who made the compromise. Within the next six months, Indian troops were withdrawn from Telangana by Patel, leaving the field open to the Razakars. The Nizam used this period to mount an offensive against the peasant armed struggle, to shore up his own rule, to maintain secret contacts with Pakistan - but he c</p>
